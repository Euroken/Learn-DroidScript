<p>
A duck made her nest under some leaves.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/007.png"><img src="Img/007.png" alt="THE DUCK'S NEST"></a>
</p>

<p>
She sat on the eggs to keep them warm.
</p>

<p>
At last the eggs broke, one after the other. Little ducks came out.
</p>

<p>
Only one egg was left. It was a very large one.
</p>

<p>
At last it broke, and out came a big, ugly duckling.
</p>

<p>
"What a big duckling!" said the old duck. "He does not look like
us. Can he be a turkey?--We will see. If he does not like the water,
he is not a duck."
</p>

<p>
The next day the mother duck took her ducklings to the pond.

<a href="Img/009.png"><img src="Img/009.png" alt="THE DUCK TAKES HER DUCKLINGS TO SWIM"></a>
</p>

<p>
Splash! Splash! The mother duck was in the water. Then she called
the ducklings to come in. They all jumped in and began to swim. The
big, ugly duckling swam, too.
</p>

<p>
The mother duck said, "He is not a turkey. He is my own little duck.
He will not be so ugly when he is bigger."
</p>

<p>
Then she said to the ducklings, "Come with me. I want you to see the
other ducks. Stay by me and look out for the cat."
</p>

<p>
They all went into the duck yard. What a noise the ducks made!
</p>

<p>
While the mother duck was eating a big bug, an old duck bit the ugly
duckling.
</p>

<p>
"Let him alone," said the mother duck. "He did not hurt you."
</p>

The mother duck said, "I know he is not pretty. But he is very good."
</p>

<p>
Then she said to the ducklings, "Now, my dears, have a good time."
</p>

<p>
But the poor, big, ugly duckling did not have a good time.
</p>

<p>
The hens all bit him. The big ducks walked on him.
</p>

<p>
The poor duckling was very sad. He did not want to be so ugly. But
he could not help it.
</p>

<p>
He ran to hide under some bushes. The little birds in the bushes were
afraid and flew away.
</p>

<p>
"It is all because I am so ugly," said the duckling. So he ran away.
</p>

<p>
At night he came to an old housexx. The housexx looked as if it would fall
down. It was so old. But the windxx blew so hard that the duckling went
into the housexx.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/014.png"><img src="Img/014.png" alt="THE UGLY DUCKLING FINDS THE OLD HOUSE"></a>
</p>

<p>
An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen.
</p>

<p>
The old woman said, "I will keep the duck. I will have some eggs."

<p>
The next day, the cat saw the duckling and began to growl.
</p>

<p>
The hen said, "Can you lay eggs?" The duckling said, "No."
</p>

<p>
"Then keep still," said the hen. The cat said, "Can you growl?"
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/015.png"><img src="Img/015.png" alt="THE CAT SAID, 'CAN YOU GROWL?'"></a>

<p>
"No," said the duckling.
</p>

<p>
"Then keep still," said the cat.
</p>

<p>
And the duckling hid in a corner. The next day he went for a walk. He
saw a big pond. He said, "I will have a good swim."
</p>

<p>
But all of the animals made fun of him. He was so ugly.

<p>
The summer went by.
</p>

<p>
Then the leaves fell and it was very cold. The poor duckling had a
hard time.
</p>

<p>
It is too sad to tell what he did all winter.
</p>

<p>
At last it was spring.
</p>

<p>
The birds sang. The ugly duckling was big now.
</p>

<p>
One day he flew far away.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/017.png"><img src="Img/017.png" alt="'OH, SEE THE LOVELY SWAN!'"></a>
</p>

<p>
Soon he saw three white swans on the lake.
</p>

<p>
He said, "I am going to see those birds. I am afraid they will kill
me, for I am so ugly."
</p>

<p>
He put his head down to the water. What did he see? He saw himself in
the water. But he was not an ugly duck. He was a white swan.
</p>

<p>
The other swans came to see him.
</p>

<p>
The children said, "Oh, see the lovely swans. The one that came last
is the best."
</p>

<p>
And they gave him bread and cake.
</p>

<p>
It was a happy time for the ugly duckling.

<p>
A little pine tree was in the woods.
</p>

<p>
It had no leaves. It had needles.
</p>

<p>
The little tree said, "I do not like needles. All the other trees in
the woods have pretty leaves. I want leaves, too. But I will have
better leaves. I want gold leaves."
</p>

<p>
Night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came by and gave
it gold leaves.

<p>
When the little tree woke it had leaves of gold.
</p>

<p>
It said, "Oh, I am so pretty! No other tree has gold leaves."
</p>

<p>
Night came.
</p>

<p>
A man came by with a bag. He saw the gold leaves. He took them all and
put them into his bag.
</p>

<p>
The poor little tree cried, "I do not want gold leaves again. I will
have glass leaves."

<p>
So the little tree went to sleep. The fairy came by and put the glass
leaves on it.
</p>

<p>
The little tree woke and saw its glass leaves.
</p>

<p>
How pretty they looked in the sunshine! 'No other tree was so bright.
</p>

<p>
Then a windxx came up. It blew and blew.
</p>

<p>
The glass leaves all fell from the tree and were broken.

<p>
Again the little tree had no leaves. It was very sad, and said, "I
will not have gold leaves and I will not have glass leaves. I want
green leaves. I want to be like the other trees."
</p>

<p>
And the little tree went to sleep. When it woke, it was like other
trees. It had green leaves.
</p>

<p>
A goat came by. He saw the green leaves on the little tree. The
goat was hungry and he ate all the leaves.

needles best."
</p>

<a href="Img/024.png"><img src="Img/024.png" alt="THE PINE TREE WITH NEEDLES"></a>

<p>
And the little tree went to sleep. The fairy gave it what it wanted.

When it woke, it had its needles again. Then the little pine tree
was happy.

<p>
It was very cold. The snow fell and it was almost dark.

<p>
It was the last day of the year.
</p>

<p>
A little match girl was running in the street. Her name was Gretchen.
She had no hat on.
</p>

<p>
Her feet were bare. When she left home, she had on some big slippers
of her mama's. But they were so large that she lost them when she ran
across the street.

<p>
Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron.

She had a little bunch in her hand.

<p>
But she could not sell her matches. No one would buy them.
</p>

<p>
Poor little Gretchen!
</p>

<p>
She was cold and hungry.
</p>

<p>
The snow fell on her curly hair. But she did not think about that.
</p>

<p>
She saw lights in the houses.
</p>

<p>
She smelled good things cooking.
</p>

<p>
She said to herself, "This is the last night of the year."

Gretchen got colder and colder.

<p>
She was afraid to go home. She knew her papa would whip her, if she
did not take some money to him.
</p>

<p>
It was as cold at home as in the street. They were too poor to have
a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep out the windxx.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen did not even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags.

<p>
Her little hands were almost frozen.
</p>

<p>
She took a match and lighted it to warm her hands. The match looked
like a little candle.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen thought she was sitting by a big stove. It was so bright.
</p>

<p>
She put the match near her feet, to warm them. Then the light went
out. She did not think that she was by the stove any more.

<p>
Gretchen lighted another match.

<p>
Now she thought she could look into a room. In this room was a table.
</p>

<p>
A white cloth and pretty dishes were on the table. There was a roast
turkey, too. It was cooked and ready to eat. The knife and fork were
in his back. The turkey jumped from the dish and ran to the little
girl.
</p>

<p>
The light went out and she was in the cold and dark again.

a Christmas tree. Very many candles were on the tree. It was full
of pretty things.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen put up her little hands. The light went out.
</p>

<p>
The lights on the Christmas tree went up, up--until she saw they
were the stars.

Then she saw a star fall.

<p>
"Some one is dying," said little Gretchen.
</p>

<p>
Her grandma had been very good to the little girl. But she was dead.
</p>

<p>
The grandma had said, "When a star falls some one is going to God."
</p>

<p>
The little girl lighted another match. It made a big light.

Gretchen thought she saw her grandma. She never looked so pretty

went away."
</p>

<p>
Then Gretchen lighted a bunch of matches. She wanted to keep her
grandma with her. The matches made it very light.
</p>

<p>
The grandma took the little girl in her arms. They went up, up--where
they would never be cold or hungry.

They were with God.

Some men found a little girl in the street. She was dead.

In her hand were the burned matches.

They said, "Poor little thing, she froze to death."

They did not know how happy she was in heaven.

<p>
The wolf ran off and took a short way, but Red Riding-Hood stopped to
pick some flowers.
</p>

<p>
When the wolf got to the housexx, he tapped on the door.
</p>

<p>
The grandma said, "Who is there?" The wolf made his voice as soft as
he could. He said, "It is little Red Riding-Hood, grandma."
</p>

<p>
Then the old lady said, "Pull the string and the door will open."
</p>

<p>
The wolf pulled the string and the door opened.
</p>

<p>
He ran in and ate the poor old lady.
</p>

<p>
Then he jumped into her bed and put on her cap.
