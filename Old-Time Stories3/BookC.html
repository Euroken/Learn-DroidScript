<p>
Long, long ago there lived a king in Greece. He had two little
children, a boy and a girl.
</p>

<p>
They were good children and loved each other very much.
</p>

<p>
One day they were playing in the garden.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Helle, look!" said the boy.
</p>

<p>
There on the grass was a fine large sheep. This sheep had a fleece of
gold and his horns were gold, too.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/103.png"><img src="Img/103.png" alt="THE KING AND HIS TWO CHILDREN"></a>
</p>

<p>
The children wanted to pat the sheep, but they could not catch him.
When they went near, he ran away on the clouds.
</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>
Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came, too.
</p>

<p>
By and by he grew tame and let the children pat his golden fleece.
</p>

<p>
One day the boy said, "Helle, let us take a ride."
</p>

<p>
First he helped his sister on the sheep's back.
</p>

<p>
Then he got on and held to the horns.
</p>

<p>
"Hold tight to me, Helle," he said.
</p>

<p>
The sheep went up, up into the sky, and ran a long way on the clouds.
But Helle got dizzy and fell down into the sea.
</p>

<p>
The boy felt very bad to lose his sister, but went right on.
</p>

<p>
Then he came to the land Colchis. He killed the sheep and gave the
golden fleece to the king.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/106.png"><img src="Img/106.png" alt="THE BOY GIVES THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO THE KING"></a>

<a href="Img/107.png"><img src="Img/107.png" alt="THE SHEEP WENT UP INTO THE SKY AND RAN A LONG WAY ON

</p>

<p>
By the tree was a dragon. The dragon never went to sleep. He would not
let any one but the king come to the tree.
</p>

<p>
So no one could get the golden fleece.

<p>
Jason was a brave young man. He lived a little way from the king's
city.
</p>

<p>
One day the king gave a big party and invited Jason.
</p>

<p>
It was a very dark night and it rained hard.
</p>

<p>
Jason had to go across a creek, but there was no bridge.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/109.png"><img src="Img/109.png" alt="JASON COMES TO THE KING'S HOUSE"></a>
</p>

<p>
The creek was full of water and Jason had to wade.
</p>

<p>
One of his shoe-strings came untied and he lost his shoe in the
water.
</p>

<p>
When he came to the king's housexx, he had but one shoe.
</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>
The king did not like this, for a fairy had said, "The man who shall
come to your housexx with one shoe, will be king."
</p>

<p>
So he knew Jason was to be king.

Then he said to Jason, "You may be king when you bring me the golden
fleece."
</p>

<p>
Jason was glad to go, and asked many brave men to go with him.
</p>

<p>
To get the golden fleece they would have to fight wild men and
animals.
</p>

<p>
They made a big ship which they named "Argo."
</p>

<p>
The men who went on the Argo were called Argonauts.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h2 class="w3-text-shadow ctr"><a name="x">JASON AND THE HARPIES.</a></h2>

</tbody></table>

<p>
The ship Argo sailed a long way. There were two strong men on the
ship. They had wings and could fly.
</p>

<p>
One day the Argo came to a land where the blind king lived.
</p>

<p>
This poor king had a hard time. When he sat down to the table to eat,
some ugly birds called Harpies, came too. The Harpies had skin like
brass and nobody could hurt them. They had claws of iron, and
scratched people when they tried to drive them away.
</p>

<p>
When the king's dinner was ready, the Harpies came and took it away.
When Jason and his men came, the king told them all about it. Jason
said they would help him.
</p>



<table class="w3-table-all w3-striped w3-xlarge w3-centered w3-card-2">

<p>
They all sat down to the table. When the food was put on the table,
the Harpies came flying in. Jason and his men took their swords.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/114.png"><img src="Img/114.png" alt="JASON TRIES TO KILL THE HARPIES"></a>
</p>

<p>
They cut at the Harpies but could not hurt them.
</p>

<p>
Then the two men with wings flew up in the air. The Harpies were
afraid and flew away. The men flew after them.
</p>

<p>
At last the Harpies grew very tired and fell into the sea and were
drowned.
</p>

<p>
Then the men with wings came back.
</p>

<p>
Now the blind king could eat all he wanted.
</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>
It was now time for Jason and his friends to go away.
</p>

<p>
The king thanked them over and over again for helping him.
</p>

<p>
When they said good-bye, he told them how to get to the land where
they would find the golden fleece.
</p>

<p>
On the sea where Jason and his men had to sail, were two big rocks.
These rocks moved on the waterlike icebergs.
</p>

<p>
They were as high as a big hill. They would come closeyy to each other,
then they would go far apart.
</p>



<table class="w3-table-all w3-striped w3-xlarge w3-centered w3-card-2">

<tr><td width="33%">rowxx</td><td width="33%">almost</td><td width="33%">rocks</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
When fishes swam in the water the rocks would come together and kill
the fishes.
</p>

<p>
If birds flew in the air, the rocks would come together and kill
birds.
</p>

<p>
If a boat sailed on the water, the rocks would come together and break
the boat into little pieces.
</p>

<p>
These rocks had been put in the sea, so no one could go to the land
where the golden fleece was.
</p>

<p>
When the ship Argo came to the rocks, Jason sent a doveyy out.
</p>

<p>
The rocks came together when the doveyy was almost past.
</p>

<p>
Then they went far apart. Jason made his men rowxx as hard as they
could.
</p>

<p>
The rocks began to come together. "Rowxx hard, my men," said Jason.
</p>

<p>
Just as they got past, the rocks hit, but Jason and his men were all
right.
</p>

<p>
So they came to Colchis.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
When Jason came to Colchis, he went to the king and said, "Will you
give me the golden fleece?"
</p>

<p>
The king wanted to keep the fleece.
</p>

<p>
So he said to Jason, "You may have it, but you must do something
for me first."
</p>

<p>
"You must plow with the brass bulls, and plant the dragon's teeth."
</p>

<p>
The brass bulls looked like real bulls, but they were larger and
stronger.
</p>

<p>
They blew out fire and smoke from their noses and mouths.
</p>

<p>
The bulls had a stall made of iron and stone. They had to be tied
with strong iron chains.
</p>

<p>
When the dragon's teeth were planted, iron men grew up.
</p>

<p>
They always killed the one who had planted them.
</p>

<p>
The king wanted the bulls to kill Jason.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/121.png"><img src="Img/121.png" alt="MEDEA GATHERS FLOWERS"></a>
</p>

<p>
He said, "If the bulls do not kill him the iron men will."
</p>

<p>
The king had a daughter named Medea. She saw Jason was a brave
young man and did not want him killed.
</p>

<p>
She knew how to help him. She stepped into her carriage, which was
pulled by flying snakes.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea flew through the air. She went to hills and creeks and
picked all kinds of flowers.
</p>

<p>
She took the flowers home and cooked them.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea went to Jason when the king did not know it.
</p>

<p>
She said to Jason, "Rub your face and hands and legs with this juice."
</p>

<p class="ctr">
<a href="Img/123.png"><img src="Img/123.png" alt="MEDEA GIVES JASON THE JUICE"></a>
</p>

<p>
When he did this, he was as strong as a giant.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could hurt him then. Fire could not burn him, and swords
could not cut him.
</p>

<p>
The next day Jason had to plow with the brass bulls and plant the
dragon's teeth.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning, the king and princess went out to the place.
</p>

<p>
They had good seats where they could see well.
</p>

<p>
All the people in the city came out to see Jason plow.
</p>

<p>
The little boys climbed the trees so they could see better.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason came to the place. The stall where the brass bulls were
tied was not far off.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened and Jason went in.
</p>

<p>
He untied the bulls and took hold of their horns.
</p>

<p>
Then he made the bulls come out of their stall.
</p>

<p>
The bulls were very angry and blew fire and smoke from their mouths.
</p>

<p>
This made the cruel king glad. But the people who saw it were afraid.
They did not want Jason killed. They did not know that the princess
had helped him.
</p>

<p>
Jason pushed the bulls' heads down to the ground. Then they kicked at
him with their feet, but could not hurt him.
</p>

<p>
He held their heads down on the ground until the plow was ready.
</p>

<p>
Jason took the chains in one hand. He took the handle of the plow in
the other.
</p>

<p>
The bulls jumped and wanted to run away.
</p>

<p>
But Jason held so hard they had to go very slowly.
</p>

<p>
When it was noon the ground was all plowed.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason let the bulls go.
</p>

<p>
They were so angry that they ran away to the woods.
</p>

<p>
Now Jason went to the king and said, "Give me the dragon's teeth."
</p>

<p>
The king gave him his hat full.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason planted the dragon's teeth, just as a man plants wheat.
</p>

<p>
By this time he was very tired, so he went to lie down.

<p>
In the evening he came back.
</p>

<p>
The iron men were growing up. Some of the men had only their feet in
the ground.
</p>

<p>
Some of them were in the ground up to their knees.
</p>

<p>
Some had only their heads out. They all tried to get out so they could
kill Jason.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason did what Medea told him he should do.
</p>

<p>
He took a giant's marble and threw it near the men.
</p>

<p>
All the iron men wanted to get the marble.
</p>

<p>
So they began to fight each other. As soon as one had his feet out of
the ground, he cut at the man next to him. So they killed each other.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason took his sword and cut off all the heads that were out of
the ground.
</p>

<p>
So all the iron men were killed and the king was very angry.

But Medea and the people were glad.

<p>
The next day Jason went to the king and said, "Now, give me the

</p>

<p>
The king did not give it to him, but said, "Come again."
</p>

<p>
Then Medea said, "If you want the golden fleece, you must help
yourself. My father will not give it to you. A dragon is by the tree
where the golden fleece is, and he never sleeps. He is always hungry
and eats people if they go near him. I can not kill him but I can make
him sleep. He is very fond of cake. I will make some cake and put in
something to make the dragon sleep."

<p>
So Medea made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the

<p>
The dragon ate them all and went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Then Jason climbed over the dragon and took the nail out of the tree.
</p>

<p>
He put the golden fleece under his coat and ran to the ship Argo.

<p>
Medea went with him and became his wife.

<p>
At last Medea and Jason and the other Argonauts came to Greece.
</p>

<p>
Jason's father was there. He was a very old man. Jason wanted his
father to be king, so he asked Medea to make the old man young.
</p>

<p>
Then Medea took her carriage and flew through the air.
</p>

<p>
She did not come back for nine days. She picked flowers from the
hills. She found all kinds of stones, too.
</p>

Then she put a stick into the pot and leaves grew on it.
</p>

<p>
Some of the juice fell on the ground and grass grew up.
</p>

<p>
So Medea knew the juice would make things grow.
</p>

<p>
Jason's father went to sleep and Medea put some of the juice into his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
His white hair turned black and teeth grew in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
When he woke up, he looked and felt like a young man.
</p>

<p>
He lived many years and when he died Jason was king.
